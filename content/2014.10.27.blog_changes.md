Short news from by blog:

Yesterday I publish my blog with a brand new theme.
The main reason is to not have the classical bootstrap theme like everybody
else. Nevertheless I am no graphic artist that is why I use a theme designed by
someone else.

The theme is based on Maggner theme, created by Templateify and adapted to
pelican by [Klaus Laube](https://github.com/kplaube/maggner-pelican).

For the moment there is some minors problems :

  * The twitter and google+ buttons at the bottoms of articles are in Espagnoles
    (or something similar)
  * I want to add some links in the menu to have links to my [home
    page](https://www.maggick.fr) and to my [notes](https://maggick.fr/notes)
    but this is not working for the moment
  * The pictures in the article does not seems to work

I will try to fix this problems in the next few weeks, in the same time I will
add images to each article already published and mostly refocus on the articles
in order to write new ones.

_Edit:_

  * 29/10/14: I changed the social button language for English nevertheless the
    Facebook button is not present
