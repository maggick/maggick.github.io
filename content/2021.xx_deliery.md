This is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Delivery](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/308) created by
[ippsec](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/3769) and publish on
January 9 2021.
This box is classified as an easy machine. The user part involve to understand a
process and exploit some functionnal flow.
The root part implies enumeration and cracking somes hashes binary.

Looking at the "contact-us" section we discover that we will probably need a
email adresse on the "delivery.htb" domain in order to access the MatterMost
server.

>For unregistered users, please use our HelpDesk to get in touch with our team. Once you have an @delivery.htb email address, you'll be able to have access to our MatterMost server.

We got to the help desk page.

![help desk page](/media/2021.xx/delivery_02.png)

We create a ticket and got an associated email adresse with the <ticket number>@delivery.htb

![associated email address](/media/2021.xx/delivery_03.png)

we create an account on mettermost with this email and got the verification URL on the ticket

The discussion give us the creds for the OSTicket application and disclose some info about password reuse

>@developers Please update theme to the OSTicket before we go live.  Credentials to the server are maildeliverer:Youve_G0t_Mail!

>Also please create a program to help us stop re-using the same passwords everywhere.... Especially those that are a variant of "PleaseSubscribe!"

>PleaseSubscribe! may not be in RockYou but if any hacker manages to get our hashes, they can use hashcat rules to easily crack all variations of common words or phrases.


We can now access the OSticket panel as an admin using the agent panel http://helpdesk.delivery.htb/scp/login.php

The mailideriverer account also got an SSH account on the box which allow us to
get the user flag.

We enumerate our user permission and found the MatterMost configuration file
containing the crendentials to access the database

    :::text

We connect to the mysql database, enumerate the tables and dump the users and
password from the `Users` table.

We create a dictionary using the disclosed password and using `hashcat` rules we
generate a few variations.

    $ cat dic

    $ hashcat --force dic -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --stdout > dic_hc

We pass this variation dictionary to `john` with the database hashes, and found
a password.

# Wrapping up

A really interesting an realistic box. There is no technical vulnerability or
exploit to use here. Just reading the applications and understanding what is
needed and found a way to achieve our attacker goal.
