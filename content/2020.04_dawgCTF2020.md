This weekend I participate to the DawgCTF with the team
`hackers for the jilted generation`. We finished 46th with 4530 points.
Here are some writeup about the cryptography challenges.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Crypto

For most of the crypto challenges we are provided with client python script that
allow to connect to the oracle service.

## Take It Back Now, Y'all (25)

The first crypto challenge is a simple sanity check.

Here is the provided client:

    :::python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
    Created for Spring 2020 CTF
    Cryptography 0
    10 Points
    Welcome to my sanity check.  You'll find this to be fairly easy.
    The oracle is found at umbccd.io:13370, and your methods are:
        flg - returns the flag
        tst - returns the message after the : in "tst:..."

We connect using telnet and call the `flg` method.

    :::text
    telnet crypto.ctf.umbccd.io 13370
    Trying 3.81.180.84...
    Connected to crypto.ctf.umbccd.io.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    flg
    DawgCTF{H3ll0_W0rld!}Connection closed by foreign host.

## One Hop This Time, One Hop This Time (75)

The second one is nothing complicated either.

Here is the client:

    :::python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
    Created for Spring 2020 CTF
    Cryptography 1
    40 Points
    Welcome to the one time pad oracle!
    Our oracle's function is enc := key ^ msg | dec := key ^ ct
    The oracle is found at umbccd.io:13371, and your methods are:
        flg - returns the encrypted flag
        enc - returns the encryption of the message after the : in "enc:..."
        dec - returns the decryption of the ciphertext after the : in "dec:..."

    @author: pleoxconfusa
    """

We open a socket, grab the encrypted flag and decrypt it.

    :::python
    import socket

    s = socket.socket()

    port = 13371
    host = 'crypto.ctf.umbccd.io'

    # connect to the server on local computer
    s.connect((host, port))

    s.send(b'flg')
    flag=(s.recv(1024))
    print(flag)
    s.send(b'dec:'+flag)
    print(s.recv(1024))
    s.close()

## Right Foot Two Stomps (200)

Here is the provided client:

    :::python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
    Created for Spring 2020 CTF
    Cryptography 2
    100 Points
    Welcome to the AES-CBC oracle!
    Our oracle's function is AES-CBC.
    The oracle is found at umbccd.io:13372, and your methods are:
        flg - returns the encrypted flag
        enc - returns the encryption of the message after the : in "enc:..."
              as 16 bytes of initialization vector followed by the ciphertext.
        dec - returns the decryption of the ciphertext after the : in "dec:<16 bytes iv>..."
              as a bytes string.

We open a socket, grab the encrypted flag, send some data to get the IV, and
send back the flag with the IV to decrypt it.

    :::python
    import socket

    s = socket.socket()

    port = 13372
    host = 'crypto.ctf.umbccd.io'

    s.connect((host, port))

    s.send(b'flg')
    flag=(s.recv(1024))
    #print(flag)
    s.send(b'enc:test')
    r=(s.recv(1024))
    #print(r)
    iv=r[0:16]
    #print(iv)
    s.send(b'dec:'+iv+flag)
    r=(s.recv(1024))
    print(r)
    s.close()

## Left Foot Two Stomps (250)

This the only offline challenge and we didn't get any client for this one.
The only information was the following:

>n=960242069 e=347 c=346046109,295161774,616062960,790750242,259677897,945606673,

>851931432,657690757,851931432,284629213,289862692,788320338,770057231,770121847

This looks like some RSA with "small numbers" ;)

We can easily factorise `n`. Once we know `n` we can compute `phi`.

    :::text
    n=960242069=151*6359219
    Phi = (p-1)(q-1) = 150*6359218 = 953882700
    e = 347
    ed = 1 mod 953882700

Then, as we already know `e` we can compute `d` with a simple python loop.

    :::text
    >>> i = 347
    >>> while (347*i%953882700 !=1):
    ...     i+=1
    ...
    >>> i
    5497883

We create a list `c` of the number as in the challenge description and decode
every element using our RSA numbers.

    :::text
    >>> c=[346046109,295161774,616062960,<SNIP>,770057231,770121847]
    >>> for elem in c:
    ...     print(chr((elem**5497883)%960242069))

This was a bit long as a single process is involved but at the end we got the
following output: `xhBQCUIcbPf7IN88AT9FDFsqEOOjNM8uxsFrEJZRRifKB1E=|key=visionary`

I struggle a lot before thinking about that being a Vigenere cipher using the
key `visionary`. At first I was thinking about AES-CBC (as the other challenges) but
we don't have any IV here.

Once decrypted with the key we get the following: `zJIOHIldUx7QF88MG9FMHxiMGAwNV8wckNjQWZATnxST1Q=`

We decrypt the base64:

    :::text
    $ echo -ne 'czJIOHIldUx7QF88MG9FMHxiMGAwNV8wckNjQWZATnxST1Q=' | base64 -d
    s2H8r%uL{@_<0oE0|b0`05_0rCcAf@N|ROT

And then a ROT47 give us the flag: `DawgCTF{Lo0k_@t_M3_1_d0_Cr4p7o}`

## Slide To The Left (350)

The client code is exactly the same as "Right Foot Two Stomps".

    :::python

    Welcome to the AES-CBC oracle!

        enc - returns the encryption of the message after the : in "enc:..."

        dec - returns the decryption of the ciphertext after the : in "dec:<16 bytes iv>..."
              as a bytes string.

    """

If we rerun the code for the previous challenge we get: `b'We already did this one.'`

Which is obviously is not the flag. We didn't solve this challenge in time.
I tried solve it using
[Oracle padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) but this
was for the next challenge :(

# Misc

There was one "Misc" challenge that actually was crypto.

## Let Her Eat Cake! 75

We got some description and photo about
[Elizebeth Smith Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizebeth_Smith_Friedman)
and then a cipher text

> Hwyjpgxwkmgvbxaqgzcsnmaknbjktpxyezcrmlja?
> GqxkiqvcbwvzmmxhspcsqwxyhqentihuLivnfzaknagxfxnctLcchKCH{CtggsMmie_kteqbx}

This clearly look like some Polyalphabetic substitution. In fact this is a simple
Viegenere cipher using the key `AICGBIJC` (we decode it using
[dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher)).

# Wrapping up

This CTF was fun as there was a lot of task but "easy" ones. Which give you some
need to continue solving the other ones.

I am really proud of the team as we get nice score!
