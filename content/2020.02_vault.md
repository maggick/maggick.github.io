## Getting started

Running dev server and exporting the `vault` address
>The dev server is a built-in, pre-configured server that is not very secure but useful for playing with Vault locally.

    :::text
    $ ./vault server -dev
    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

We can get the server status with the `status` command. The server is
initialized and unsealed.

    :::text
    $ ./vault status
    Key             Value
    ---             -----
    Seal Type       shamir
    Initialized     true
    Sealed          false
    Total Shares    1
    Threshold       1
    Version         1.3.0
    Cluster Name    vault-cluster-f6bdd069
    Cluster ID      14ded467-9ad3-3fc4-4403-bea46156b766
    HA Enabled      false

# Vault for pentesters

What is really interesting is how to steal vault's secrets and maybe escalate
your privileges.
For the following we simulate a situation where we compromised a GNU/Linux
box and get a user shell.

## Detecting the vault

First of all we need to know of vault is running on the machine. For that we can
run a simple `ps`.

    :::text
    $ ps aux | grep vault
    root      2442  0.0  3.3  69564 68136 ?        SLsl 06:56   0:01 vault server -config /vault/config/config.hcl

## Login

Then we need to login on the vault in order to get some information. Vault allow
sixteen login methods. Here we will present only two of them:

1. token: the default method, a token is use to identify the user.
2. username: "classical" username/password authentication method

In order to use a non default method you need to use the `--method` option for
instance:

    :::text
    $ vault login -method=userpass username=my-username
    Password (will be hidden):

For more information about
[vault's authentication methods](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html).

In order to get a foothold on the vault instance we will need some
credentials: enumerate!

### Root policy

Once login on the vault we can list our permission if we are in the "root"
policy we get a root access to the vault and can access every secret.

    :::text
    $ vault login
    Token (will be hidden):
    Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
    is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
    again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9
    token_accessor       1dd7b9a1-f0f1-f230-dc76-46970deb5103
    token_duration       ∞
    token_renewable      false
    token_policies       ["root"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["root"]


If you do not have access to the "root" policy, you will still have access to
some secrets, maybe only with the right permissions.

Either ways, you should enumerate and see what you can do from there.

## Enumerating the secrets engines

It is quit simple to list the available secrets engine (for a more detailed
output you can add the `-detailed` parameter):

    :::text
    $ vault secrets list
    Path          Type         Description
    ----          ----         -----------
    cubbyhole/    cubbyhole    per-token private secret storage
    secret/       kv           key/value secret storage
    sys/          system       system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging

## Enumerating the secrets for an engine

Once you know which secrets engines are running you will be able to list the
secrets from them.

Here we will list the secret from the basic kv (key-value) secrets engine.

If the vault is accessible with HTTP, open your browser and login to list
graphically the available information.

![Exploring the secrets' secrets](/media/2020.02/vault_2.png)

![Displaying the value associated to the "foo" key](/media/2020.02/vault_3.png)

If you do not have access to a web interface, you can list the secret using the
CLI.

    :::text
    $ ./vault kv list secret/
    Keys
    ----
    adsfdasfdas
    hello
    $ ./vault kv list secret/
    Keys
    ----
    adsfdasfdas
    hello
    $ ./vault kv get secret/hello
    ====== Metadata ======
    Key              Value
    ---              -----
    created_time     2019-11-15T14:10:00.428186002Z
    deletion_time    n/a
    destroyed        false
    version          2

    === Data ===
    Key    Value
    ---    -----
    foo    world


## SSH

Vault allow to store other object than key:value couples. For instance it is
possible to configure Vault to provide a one time password to connect with ssh
to a remote server (with the contribution of an ssh-helper client side. More
information on how to install this:
[documentation OTP SSH](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords.html))

Once installed and configured it allow to connect to "remote" host:

    user@vm:~$ vault ssh -mode=otp -role=root_otp root@127.0.0.1
    Vault could not locate "sshpass". The OTP code for the session is displayed
    below. Enter this code in the SSH password prompt. If you install sshpass,
    Vault can automatically perform this step for you.
    OTP for the session is: 3ee17d0c-1eef-a286-fd6d-e50702c38c00

    :::text
    Password:
    root@vm:~# id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

This might allow you to pivot from the compromised host to another.

# Short conclusion

This article just scratch the vault surface as there is [eighteen secrets
engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html) at the moment and I
have not speak about sealing and unsealing the vault.
This solution can resolve some authentication and secret sharing issues but
it is crucial that the vault's authentication secrets are well keep.
