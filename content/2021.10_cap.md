This article is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:

This box is rated as easy box the user part implies to know a bit about array
indexes and wireshark. The root part is quit easy and implies a binary
capabilities.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# User

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only port 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH) and 80 with a HTTP
service are open.

## FTP

No anonymous connection is available on it.

## Web

This is a server monitoring website. We can access a few technical information
as the result of the `ip a` command.

![Result of ip a command](/media/2021.10/cap_01.png)

We also have access to a "capture and analyze packets" tool which make me think
about a tcpdump or wireshark RCE exploit.

![Packet capture and analyzer](/media/2021.10/cap_02.png)

But this was quit simpler. Notice the "index" in the picture above: 1. Or in
programming language, most table start with the index 0. We just change the URL
to `data/0` and open the pcap with wireshark.

We can see a few FTP frames. The FTP traffic is in clear text, we use the
"follow TCP stream" option from wireshark and get the FTP packets containing a
username and a password.

We can connect using FTP and get access to Nathan's files but the user is using the same password for his SSH access :S

# Root

We quickly check our `sudo` privileges but we do not have any.

The name of the box might be a hint here. We can run a Linux privilege
escalation tool as
[LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)
or just run the appropriate command available on
[Linux privilege escalation methodologies](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#capabilities).

We quickly found out that `/usr/bin/python3.8` has the `setuid` capabilities
which allow to [make arbitrary manipulations of process UIDs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)


    :::text
    nathan@cap:/$ getcap -r / 2> /dev/null
    /usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
    /usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
    /usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils = cap_net_raw+ep
    /usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep

We just have to run a simple python command either via the python console or in
a oneliner to pop a root shell and grab the flag.

    :::text
    nathan@cap:/$ /usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=1001(nathan) groups=1001(nathan)
    # cat /root/root.txt

# Wrapping up

This was an easy box! I struggle an bit on the "Array index" as I was in the
tcpdump/wireshark rce rabbit hole. Nonetheless a great box for every beginners.
