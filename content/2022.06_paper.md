This article is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Paper](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/432) publish on
February 05, 2022 by
[secnigma](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/92926).
This box is rated as an easy machine. It implies a verbose header, a vulnerable
[WordPress](https://0day.work/proof-of-concept-for-wordpress-5-2-3-viewing-unauthenticated-posts/)
a rocket chat bot and the
[PolKit](https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/) exploit.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Foothold and user

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only port 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) and 22 (SSH) are
open.

The website is a default `nginx` page.

We run a `niko` on the box and found the header disclosing the `office.paper` subdomain.

The new website is a WordPress with a few articles and comments mentioning
sensible data in the drats article.

![Wordpress](/media/2022.06/paper_02.png)


The different articles and comments show that there might be juicy information
in draft posts and that they are not as secure as `prisonmike` think.
We run a `wpscan` on it.

The site is vulnerable to [CVE-2019-17671](https://0day.work/proof-of-concept-for-wordpress-5-2-3-viewing-unauthenticated-posts/)
allowing unauthenticated users to view
the draft posts. We take a look at `prisonmike`'s one using the
URL ` http://office.paper/index.php/author/prisonmike/?static=1`. We got a
"secret registration URL" for the rocket chat.

We register an account and see that there is bot `recyclops` that allow to request and view
files. We can start a private discussion with it and query its help menu.

We enumerate the working directory using the `file` command and discover that
`file ../` is working.
We enumerate the folder and found the bot home directory containing a scripts
folder with a `run.js` script inside.

    :::JavaScript
    // Description:
    // Runs a command on hubot
    // TOTAL VIOLATION of any and all security!
    //
    // Commands:
    // hubot run <command> - runs a command on hubot host

    module.exports = function(robot) {
      robot.respond("/RUN (.*)$/i", function(msg) {
          console.log(msg);
          var cmd = msg.match[1];
          msg.send("Running " + cmd);
          var exec = require('child_process').exec;
          exec(cmd, function(error, stdout, stderr) {
              if (error) {
              msg.send(error);
              msg.send(stderr);
              } else {
              msg.send(stdout);
              }
              });
          });
    };

We use it and run `id`. We discover that the bot is running as the `dwight` user
on the box. We can directly grab the user flag but we want a shell as user.

    ::text
    run id
    uid=1004(dwight) gid=1004(dwight) groups=1004(dwight)

We upload our SSH key on the box.

    :::text
    run echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCzB[SNIP] kali@kali' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

We can then logging as `dwight` using SSH and grab the user flag.

    :::text
    $ ssh 10.129.138.109 -ldwight
    [dwight@paper ~]$ cat user.txt

# Root

The root part is a wild ride and I discussed it directly with the box author
[secnigma](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/92926) over Discord.

When the box was released there was a bug in
[linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng)
[fixed in the first days of the box](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/commit/48ff8b061b1724138313e362eac3cc84cc2dec73)

As you can see in the [commit](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/commit/48ff8b061b1724138313e362eac3cc84cc2dec73)
the script always flagged a box using `yum` as "Vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560"
(Polkit) if we run a
[linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) [release prior to the patch
date on the box](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20220205)
we will see that the box is marked as vulnerable.

    :::text
    [dwight@paper ~]$ sh linpeas.sh

    Vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560

Of course, running a later version does not show the box as vulnerable to the
CVE as `yum list installed | grep polkit` return an empty string.
Nonetheless the box is vulnerable to it. This information can be found using
directly `rmp` to list the package and looking at the `polkit` version (v0.113
to v0.118 are vulnerable).

## Polkit

[The Polkit exploit](https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/)
is largely documented but as it is race condition it need to be performed
quickly. Moreover the box author used a cleanup mechanism that regularly (2
minutes) rewrite the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. The box author
developed a [script, publish on github](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation/)
that automate this process. We can run the `poc.sh` on the box and `switch user`
as `secnimga` and then `sudo bash` to get a root shell and get the flag.

# Wrapping up

Overall a great realistic box with a lot of interaction and different
vulnerabilities for the user part.
