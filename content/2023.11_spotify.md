*tl;dr:* go to [Spotify_RAS](https://maggick.fr/Spotify_RAS/). A tool that choose Spotify albums from
your saved ones and add them to your playing queue.

I listen to music all day. Mostly Video game music and I have been collecting albums for years.
As a result I have around 400 albums saved in Spotify (and still growing), so every morning choosing
my soundtrack of the day was a complex task and I end up listening a lot to the same albums.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

For a time I used [Paul's Random Album Selector](https://www.nativenoise.co.za/spotify/album-selector/).

Once Paul's application had selected the albums and put them in a random order it was still necessary
to manually add them to the playing queue by opening them one by one in the Spotify web app.
It was tedious and, as the Spotify web UI is not the most responsive, it still took me minutes per
day to set up my day's soundtrack.

So I decided to develop my own Random Album Selector (*writing this I feel like I should change the name :/*).
The goal was to reduce as much as possible the user interactions with the application. So it had to:

* automatically select the albums
* add them to the playing queue without user interaction
* it would be nice if it was also possible to select tracks for the user's favorites tracks (this friend request).

As the application is still in ["development"](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes)
mode I need to manually add each user to the application (Spotify username and email).
If you want to use it I will need to add your information to the users' whitelist.


## Technical details

I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the application core and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for the user interface.

The application is running client side only limiting the exposition of personal data.
In addition, I limited the usage of Spotify permissions to the strict minimum:
* the [user-library-read](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes#user-library-read) to read the user's library and pick its saved albums or tracks
* the [user-modify-playback-state](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes#user-modify-playback-state) to add tracks to the playlist

The page is hosted with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/maggick/Spotify_RAS).
