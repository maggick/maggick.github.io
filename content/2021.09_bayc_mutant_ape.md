A different kind of article about a game organized by the
[Bored Ape Yach Club](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC) a few weeks ago. The deal
was to complete five levels of a difficult game to get a
[Proof of attendance](https://poap.xyz/) token.

As a few weeks have pass since the
[end of the game](https://twitter.com/boredapeyc/status/1432886600623656969)
I will share a few tips to win every time as the game is written in JavaScript.

The game is located at [https://2dengine.com/mutantarcade/]( https://2dengine.com/mutantarcade/)

_Note:_ it seems that you are directly in the last level (5/5) using the link
above. You can find an archive with the JS files [here](/media/2021.09/mutantarcade.zip).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

As stated above and mentioned by a
[few players](https://twitter.com/luckyape_eth/status/1432886764532797440)
the game is really hard. The player only has three life for the whole five level
while the boss (the mutant ape) has 15 life per level. You must hit him 75 times
while you can only be it twice! Also the mutant's hitbox is awful.

But this is a JavaScript game so you can easily open a debugger in the tab
(before loading the game). Once you have the `console` you can manipulate the
game as you want:

* You can give yourself a lot of health and still enjoy the game using `lvl.player.health=1000`:

* Or you can just kill the boss in one key stroke (â†‘) by setting the boss health
  to 0 with `lvl.boss.health=0` for an instant boss death.


# Wrapping up

Avoid buidling game that run client side or at least verify some data server
side (game time, player life, etc.).

A different type of (shorter) post here. Let's see if this get some appreciation.
