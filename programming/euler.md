# Project Euler

## Presentation

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging
mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at
elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills
will be required to solve most problems.

Moreover you can found all my source code (most of the time without any
comment) on [Github](https://github.com/maggick/euler).
